              authorise THE GROUP to transfer your personal information to an

              MANAGEMENT AND SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION THE GROUP takes
              reasonable steps to keep your personal information secure.
              Personal information about individuals is stored on servers that
              sit behind a firewall and is physically housed within a secure
              data centre. Employee access to personal information is limited.
              We cannot and do not guarantee that your personal information will
              be protected against unauthorised access or misuse or abuse. We do
              not accept any liability for the improper actions of unauthorised
              third parties. In relation to the internet, while THE GROUP uses
              reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of your personal
              information, transmissions made by means of the internet cannot be
              made absolutely secure. THE GROUP assumes no responsibility for
              disclosure of data due to errors in transmission or by
              unauthorised third parties. THE GROUP also assumes no
              responsibility or liability for third parties such as advertisers
              or other entities who utilise banner ads and links from the Site.

              information to an advertiser, you will be subject to the privacy
              policies of those third party websites. We retain the personal
              information we collect from you for as long as the information is

              until you request that we remove the data by contacting our

              and disclose personal information about that person for the
              purposes described in this privacy policy. The Site may allow

              technologies to, among other things, enable such third party
              advertisers to record which advertisements your browser has seen
              and which site pages you have been viewing when the advertisement
              was delivered. You should make your own enquiries as to the
              privacy policies of these third parties. We are not responsible

              parties. You can prevent your browser from accepting new cookies,
              be notified when you receive a new cookie, or disable cookies
              altogether by changing your browser’s preferences menu. If you
              disable cookies, you may not be able to use the customised
              functions on the Site.
